# SCM-STARTER

**scm-starter** is a decentralized application (DApp) built using Ethereum blockchain technology. It allows users to interact with a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum network to perform basic functions.

## Features

- **View Candidates**: Users can view the list of candidates.
- **Vote**: Users can vote for their favorite candidate.
- **View Votes**: Users can see the current votes for each candidate.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: Smart contract programming language.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment.
- **React**: Frontend JavaScript library.
- **MetaMask**: Ethereum wallet integration.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: Ethereum JavaScript libraries for interaction with smart contracts.
